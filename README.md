# dividendMaster

Application that is used to analyze the earning power and/or potential of given stocks' dividends

## Design

API driven app

### Frontend

Undecided yet - perhaps Vue.js

### Backend

Python
SQLite3 Database


## New Feature Ideas

1. Hook up LLM (i.e. openAI chatgpt) and turn this into more of a chat app that provides dividend analysis
